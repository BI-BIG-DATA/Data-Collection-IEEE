    "abstract": "Blockchain is an emerging technology that has the potential to revolutionize the global industry and create a trusted relationship in a multi-party business network. There are a number of practical use cases where blockchain has been applied. One specific area is the Art industry, where it is a natural fit in the way that art forensics and transactions are conducted, tracked and recorded. This motivates us to develop the ArtChain platform to assist the Art Industry. In this paper, we present ArtChain, which is an integrated trading system based on blockchain. It includes the front end, the back end, the services, the smart contract, the chain connection and the deployment scripts from the bottom to the top. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deployed blockchain-enabled art trading platform in Australia. It provides a transparent yet privacy-preserving, and tamper-proof transaction history for registration, provenance, and traceability of art assets. Our objective analysis and evaluation show that the ArtChain platform is applicable and practical. For the interest of other researchers, our system implementation related resources are open-sourced on Github.",

    "abstract": "Proof-of-Work (PoW) is a popular protocol used in Blockchain systems to resolve double-spending problems. However, if an attacker has access to calculation hash power greater than half of the total hash power, this attacker can create a double-spending attack or 51% attack. The cost of creating a 51% attack is surprisingly low if hash power is abundantly available. That posts a great threat to lots of PoW blockchains. We propose a technique to combine history weighted information of miners with the total calculation difficulty to alleviate the 51% attack problem. Analysis indicates that with the new technique, the cost of a traditional attack is increased by two orders of magnitude.",

    "abstract": "Witnessing the increasingly pervasive deployment of security video surveillance systems(VSS), more and more individuals have become concerned with the issues of privacy violations. While the majority of the public have a favorable view of surveillance in terms of crime deterrence, individuals do not accept the invasive monitoring of their private life. To date, however, there is not a lightweight and secure privacy-preserving solution for video surveillance systems. The recent success of blockchain (BC) technologies and their applications in the Internet of Things (IoT) shed a light on this challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a Lightweight, Blockchain-based Privacy protection (Lib-Pri) scheme for surveillance cameras at the edge. It enables the VSS to perform surveillance without compromising the privacy of people captured in the videos. The Lib-Pri system transforms the deployed VSS into a system that functions as a federated blockchain network capable of carrying out integrity checking, blurring keys management, feature sharing, and video access sanctioning. The policy-based enforcement of privacy measures is carried out at the edge devices for real-time video analytics without cluttering the network.",

Blockchain has attracted many researchers and practitioners from various professions and disciplines, due to the powerful characteristics behind adopting such technology. And in order to formulate a better understanding of it, many researchers are interested in classifying the Blockchain-Based Software Systems (BBSSs). Unfortunately, none of the available taxonomies in the literature considers the various Software Engineering (SWE) aspects for building a BBSS. A blockchain subject matter expert (SME) may absorb a specific aspect understanding from each of the related taxonomies, and in order to have a complete understanding of the various options available for building a BBSS, they will have to flip from a resource to another in order to collect the scattered information they need. So, this paper aims to assist the blockchain SMEs to articulate a comprehensive understanding of the various and most recent concepts and design decisions available, in order to implement or propose a BBSS solution. The taxonomy is derived from the fundamental knowledge and the major SWE aspects which a BBSS implementer or researcher has to consider, and thus is not biased to a specific SWE aspect.",

However, because of the limited throughput, current blockchain platforms can not meet the transaction demand in practical use. Though researchers proposed many new solutions, they suffered either decentralization or security issues. In this paper, using Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, we improve the linear structure of traditional blockchain protocol. In the new structure, blocks are organized in levels and width, which will generate into a compacted DAG structure (CoDAG). To make CoDAG more efficient and secure, we design algorithms and protocols to place the new-generated blocks appropriately. Compared with traditional blockchain protocols, CoDAG improves the security and transaction verification time, and enjoys the consistency and liveness properties of blockchain. Taking adversary parties into consideration, two possible attack strategies are presented in this paper, and we further prove that CoDAG is a secure and robust protocol to resist them. The experimental results show that CoDAG can achieve 394 transactions per second, which is 56 times of Bitcoin's throughput and 26 times of Ethereum's.",

The research results indicate that the detection rate of the experimental group model is consistently higher than that of the traditional model. During the detection rate process, the average value of the experimental group is as high as 89.3%, which is much higher than the traditional model.

Moreover, the smart contract and zero-knowledge proof are employed to ensure automatic operation of the tasks and the protection users' privacy, respectively.

    "abstract": "Energy storage units (ESUs) enable several attractive features of modern smart grids such as enhanced grid resilience, effective demand response, and reduced bills. However, uncoordinated charging of ESUs stresses the power system and can lead to a blackout. In this paper, we leverage the blockchain and smart contracts to build a decentralized charging coordination mechanism without the need for a centralized charging coordinator. First ESUs should use tokens for anonymously authenticate themselves to the blockchain. Then each ESU sends a charging request that contains its State-of-Charge (SoC), Time-to-complete-charge (TCC) and amount of required charging to the smart contract address on the blockchain. The smart contract will then run the charging coordination mechanism in a self-executed manner such that ESUs with the highest priorities are charged in the present time slot while charging requests of lower priority ESUs are deferred to future time slots. In this way, each ESU can make sure that charging schedules are computed correctly. Finally, we have implemented the proposed mechanism on the Ethereum test-bed blockchain, and our analysis shows that execution cost can be acceptable in terms of gas consumption while enabling decentralized charging coordination with increased transparency, reliability, and privacy preserving.",

    "abstract": "Recently, leading research communities have been investigating the use of blockchains for Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, where multiple participants, or agents, collaborate to make consensus decisions. To achieve this, the data in the blockchain storage have to be transformed into blockchain knowledge. We refer to these types of blockchains as knowledge-based blockchains. Knowledge-based blockchains are potentially useful in building efficient risk assessment applications. An earlier work introduced probabilistic blockchain which facilitates knowledge-based blockchains. This paper proposes an extension for the probabilistic blockchain concept. The design of a reputation management framework, suitable for such blockchains, is proposed. The framework has been developed to suit the requirements of a wide range of applications. In particular, we apply it to the detection of malicious nodes and reduce their effect on the probabilistic blockchains' consensus process. We evaluate the framework by comparing it to a baseline using several adversarial strategies. Further, we analyze the collaborative decisions with and without the malicious node detection. Both results show a sustainable performance, where the proposed work outperforms others and achieves excellent results.",

    "abstract": "The fast developing Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies provide a promising opportunity to build large-scale systems to connect numerous heterogeneous devices into the Internet. Most existing IIoT infrastructures are based on a centralized architecture, which is easier for management but cannot effectively support immutable and verifiable services among multiple parties. Blockchain technology provides many desired features for large-scale IIoT infrastructures, such as decentralization, trustworthiness, trackability, and immutability. This paper presents a blockchain-based IIoT architecture to support immutable and verifiable services. However, when applying blockchain technology to the IIoT infrastructure, the required storage space posts a grant challenge to resource-constrained IIoT infrastructures. To address the storage issue, this paper proposes a hierarchical blockchain storage structure, ChainSplitter. Specially, the proposed architecture features a hierarchical storage structure where the majority of the blockchain is stored in the clouds, while the most recent blocks are stored in the overlay network of the individual IIoT networks. The proposed architecture seamlessly binds local IIoT networks, the blockchain overlay network, and the cloud infrastructure together through two connectors, the blockchain connector and the cloud connector, to construct the hierarchical blockchain storage. The blockchain connector in the overlay network builds blocks in blockchain from data generated in IIoT networks, and the cloud connector resolves the blockchain synchronization issues between the overlay network and the clouds. We also provide a case study to show the efficiency of the proposed hierarchical blockchain storage in a practical Industrial IoT case.",

These blockchain platforms are not able to interact with each other or with the outside world since only little emphasis is placed on the interoperability between them. Already proposed solutions for blockchain interoperability such as naive relay or oracle solutions are usually not broadly applicable since they are either too expensive to operate or very resource-intensive. For that reason, we propose a blockchain interoperability oracle that follows a voting-based approach based on threshold signatures. The oracle nodes generate a distributed private key to execute an off-chain aggregation mechanism to collectively respond to requests. Compared to state-of-the-art relay schemes, our approach does not incur any ongoing costs and since the on-chain component only needs to verify a single signature, we can achieve remarkable cost savings compared to conventional oracle solutions.",

With the access of a large number of heterogeneous edge devices and the in-depth development of edge computing technology in various fields, it has brought huge challenges to the security management and data privacy protection in the edge computing architecture. Therefore, this paper proposes a lightweight edge computing data privacy-preserving scheme based on blockchain and homomorphic encryption. Above all, set edge computing servers as distributed nodes of the blockchain network and utilize the decentralization of blockchain and the non-tamperable characteristics of information to ensure the distributed storage of data and information recording. Then, designing a blockchain data encryption transmission scheme based on homomorphic encryption which could guarantee data transmission between edge nodes in the form of homomorphic ciphertext. Meanwhile, supporting the verification of the legality and correctness of the transaction in the form of ciphertext. Simulation experiments show that the method proposed in this paper can carry out effective data encryption transmission and has certain application potential.",

Docking with blockchain platform is the dominant strategy of financial institutions. Blockchain can help SMEs make trustworthy decisions by promoting credit split circulation, improving financing efficiency, increasing default cost and reducing financing rate. In addition, through \"network cooperation and credit incentive\", \"joint punishment for breach of trust\" and \"reasonable revenue sharing\", the game equilibrium evolves toward the ideal state that financial institutions dare to lend, core firms and SMEs are \"Double Trustworthy\". Thus, the financing of SMEs is empowered by blockchain. Finally, according to the results of game analysis, suggestions that blockchain should be used to develop digital supply chain to meet the financing needs of SMEs are proposed.",

    "abstract": "Publish/subscribe is a communication paradigm used in distributed applications to easily exchange messages. This paradigm usually has a centralized architecture where a broker is responsible for transferring all the messages, hence can be a source of trust issues. In a threat model where the broker can be malicious, two honest entities cannot be sure of the origin of a message. There exist propositions for distributed publish/subscribe protocols replacing the broker by a blockchain. Those propositions all have in common an extensive usage of the blockchain, which makes them expensive over time, due to blockchain fees, and not scalable. In this paper, we introduce SUPRA, a distributed publish/subscribe protocol. This protocol has the same security guarantees than other solutions relying on blockchains, but where the vast majority of messages are off-chain. The message exchanges are done mostly directly between publishers and subscribers and the blockchain is only used in case of network issues, if a message is lost, or an entity is suspected to be malicious.",

    "abstract": "Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) model is an efficient solution that not only solves the problem of the agricultural product’s origin but also provides a method to share the market risk between consumers and producers. In the CSA model, consumers order and pay for products in advance. Then, the producers will send packages of fresh products to consumers after a fixed period corresponding to the paid amount. However, the critical weakness of the CSA model is the lack of solutions for both sides to demonstrate the product’s quality, which makes consumers unsure about the condition of receiving products. In consequence, consumers become hesitant to order and pay money in advance. In this paper, we will propose a novel solution that allows consumers to track their products through agricultural diaries recorded by farmers every day. The key difference of the proposed solution is to leverage Blockchain technology advantages in authenticating and protecting the integrity of information. Such that, consumers could track all steps in the production process quickly and reliably. Meanwhile, producers can build and increase their enterprise branding by transferring product information transparently and responsibly.",

Some ventures operationalize a hybrid of these two network types to enhance adoption of their blockchain platforms by broadening their base of stakeholders or facilitating interoperability between heterogeneous blockchains. In this article, we synthesize literature and industry writings to identify four hybrid blockchain architectures: hybrid blockchain approach, connected hybrid blockchain, interoperable blockchain architecture, and hard-forked blockchain for enterprise use. We then analyze these architectures along dimensions of semantic modeling support between private and public networks, data connectivity between networks, syntactic interoperability support between networks with heterogeneous codebases, governance model, and technical features. We find that hybrid blockchain ventures make trade-offs: support API's, tools, and customized development so that a codebase is useful for private and public networks or provide such support for interoperation between heterogeneous codebases. We then conduct a case study of an exemplar for a hybrid blockchain approach, the startup Insolar. We identify characteristics that have led Insolar to be idiosyncratically agile and effective in its blockchain development, which together with our architecture analysis may be timely and prescriptive as enterprises grow interested in addressing blockchain hybridity and interoperability.",

Blockchain seems very exciting yet simultaneously a bit confusing, and naturally many people, businesses, and governments approach it with high expectations while also exhibiting some hesitancy. This article will deal with the use of blockchain in relation to government applications. A proper assessment of such use requires a discussion on blockchain standards, which are currently developed, or may develop in the future. Without blockchain standards, any potential use of blockchain in government will be of limited and restricted value. This would render our discussion on government applications rather limited too. Standards enable us to appreciate blockchain applications in a useful way for future applications outside the context of government. Focusing our attention to government applications is deliberate. Blockchain, obviously, provides amazing opportunities for the private sector. Over the last years there has been widespread public disbelief in many public and government institutions. Corruption, fraud, lack of transparency, alienation and disconnection of citizen from decision-making centres oblige governments to change and offer proper governance conditions for their citizens. Further, higher consumer expectations in all sectors of the economy naturally affect the expectations of citizens vis-à-vis their governments. For the above reasons, governments could leverage the positive features of blockchain to restore their reputation and efficiency towards citizens, by using blockchain. Of course, governments can use blockchain for many of their applications. To decide the proper application of blockchain within their operations, governments must embark on a need-based approach. Standards are extremely useful in such a need-based approach.",

This has led to a rapid increase in the number of IoT devices and a consequent rise in data interactions between these devices. As a result, the management and verification of device identities have become increasingly crucial. However, current systems still rely on vast databases to store identity data and require manual intervention for authentication. This reliance on databases limits the efficiency of authentication, particularly in environments with a large number of devices. To address this challenge, we have integrated government public key infrastructure(PKI) with smart contract technology to develop an efficient and automated authentication system. Our system utilizes electronic identity cards(eID cards) as a storage medium for certificates, providing reliable identity proof. Smart contracts are then used to automatically verify the certificates and implement access control over the verification results. Our system offers not only stronger universality, reduced storage overhead, and faster authentication speed, but also higher scalability. This innovative approach paves the way for authentication in IoT devices.",

    "abstract": "IoT devices have been adopted widely in the last decade which enabled collection of various data from different environments. Data storage poses challenges since the data may be compromised during the storage and the integrity might be violated without being noticed. In such cases, integrity and data provenance are required in order to be able to detect the source of any incident and prove it in legal cases. To address these issues, blockchain provides excellent opportunities since it can protect the integrity of the data thanks to its distributed structure. However, it comes with certain costs as storing huge amount of data in a public blockchain will come with significant transaction fees. In this paper, we propose a highly cost effective and reliable digital forensics framework by exploiting multiple inexpensive blockchain networks as a temporary storage before the data is committed to Ethereum. To reduce Ethereum costs, we utilize Merkle trees which hierarchically stores hashes of the collected event data from IoT devices. We evaluated the approach on popular blockchains such as EOS, Stellar, and Ethereum by presenting a cost and security analysis. The results indicate that we can achieve significant cost savings without compromising the integrity of the data.",

    "abstract": "Voting is a pillar of modern society, but the traditional paper voting system is prone to fraud and failure. Votes can sometimes be miscounted or might be lost in transit. Besides, the electronic voting system has been active subject research for decades. However, the old traditional voting system lacks security and privacy features, which has been a challenge for a long time. As a solution, this paper is proposing a prototype blockchain-based electronic voting system for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) political election process. A blockchain system is a distributed decentralized, immutable database; that allows the data to be distributed and shared among all the participants in a network. Also, it has many advantages that can be applied in many use cases, such as electronic voting systems. Implementing the blockchain-based electronic voting system will minimize the costs of running an election while ensuring integrity. It has the potential to limit voter fraud while making the votes traceable and verifiable, preventing unauthorized activity, and fake votes by authenticating each voter in the system. The UAE has a blockchain initiative that seeks to have 50 percent paperless transactions in all its governmental processes by the end of 2021. This paper studied the effectiveness of adopting blockchain in the UAE political election.",
