Many previous studies have presented risk issues as concerns associated with the use of generative AI, but since most of these concerns are from the user's perspective, they are difficult to lead to specific countermeasures. In this study, the risk issues presented by the previous studies were broken down into more detailed elements, and risk factors and impacts were identified. In this way, we presented information that leads to countermeasure proposals for generative AI risks.CCS CONCEPTS• General and reference→Evaluation; Surveys and overviews, • Human-centered computing→HCI theory, concepts and models; • Social and professional topics→Computing / technology policy.",,,

,IEEE,Publisher: Princeton University Press,,AI Needs You: How We Can Change AI's Future and Save Our Own,Verity Harding,,"A humanist manifesto for the age of AI

Artificial intelligence may be the most transformative technology of our time. As AI’s power grows, so does the need to figure out what—and who—this technology is really for. AI Needs You argues that it is critical for society to take the lead in answering this urgent question and ensuring that AI fulfills its promise.

Verity Harding draws inspiring lessons from the histories of three twentieth-century tech revolutions—the space race, in vitro fertilization, and the internet—to empower each of us to join the conversation about AI and its possible futures. Sharing her perspective as a leading insider in technology and politics, she rejects the dominant narrative, which often likens AI’s advent to that of the atomic bomb. History points the way to an achievable future in which democratically determined values guide AI to be peaceful in its intent; to embrace limitations; to serve purpose, not profit; and to be firmly rooted in societal trust.

AI Needs You gives us hope that we, the people, can imbue AI with a deep intentionality that reflects our best values, ideals, and interests, and that serves the public good. AI will permeate our lives in unforeseeable ways, but it is clear that the shape of AI’s future—and of our own—cannot be left only to those building it. It is up to us to guide this technology away from our worst fears and toward a future that we can trust and believe in.",,,

Burden,,"Software sustainability is emerging as a primary concern, aiming to optimize resource utilization, minimize environmental impact, and promote a greener, more resilient digital ecosystem. The sustainability or ’greenness’ of software is typically determined by the adoption of sustainable coding practices. With a maturing ecosystem around generative AI, many software developers now rely on these tools to generate code using natural language prompts. Despite their potential advantages, there is a significant lack of studies on the sustainability aspects of AI-generated code. Specifically, how environmentally friendly is the AI-generated code based upon its adoption of sustainable coding practices? In this paper, we present the results of an early investigation into the sustainability aspects of AI-generated code across three popular generative AI tools — ChatGPT, BARD, and Copilot. The results highlight the default non-green behavior of tools for generating code, across multiple rules and scenarios. It underscores the need for further in-depth investigations and effective remediation strategies.CCS CONCEPTS• Social and professional topics → Sustainability; • Computing methodologies → Natural language generation.",,,

,IEEE,Publisher: IEEE,,Towards a Responsible AI Metrics Catalogue: A Collection of Metrics for AI Accountability,Boming Xia; Qinghua Lu; Liming Zhu; Sung Une Lee; Yue Liu; Zhenchang Xing,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly through the advent of large-scale generative AI (GenAI) models such as Large Language Models (LLMs), has become a transformative element in contemporary technology. While these models have unlocked new possibilities, they simultaneously present significant challenges, such as concerns over data privacy and the propensity to generate misleading or fabricated content. Current frameworks for Responsible AI (RAI) often fall short in providing the granular guidance necessary for tangible application, especially for Accountability—a principle that is pivotal for ensuring transparent and auditable decision-making, bolstering public trust, and meeting increasing regulatory expectations. This study bridges the Accountability gap by introducing our effort towards a comprehensive metrics catalogue, formulated through a systematic multivocal literature review (MLR) that integrates findings from both academic and grey literature. Our catalogue delineates process metrics that underpin procedural integrity, resource metrics that provide necessary tools and frameworks, and product metrics that reflect the outputs of AI systems.

This has become quite evident with the proliferation of national AI strategies since the first was launched in Canada in 2017. There is now an ever-growing body of national AI strategies especially in countries situated in the Global South. AI is seen as a key driver of economic development and the strategies describe how countries plan to exploit AI technologies to achieve national development goals. However, AI technologies also generate problematic and unintended consequences, and the national strategies often describe governance mechanisms for mitigating such issues. As the national development goals of many countries also align with the UN SDGs, this paper explores the relationship between responsible governance of AI, the attainment of the UN SDGs and the implications for African countries. The paper shows that there is a clear link between the development of AI and the attainment of the SDGs. Also, based on an analysis of two AI policy tracking repositories - the OECD AI Policy Observatory and Oxford AI Readiness Index – this paper shows how African countries have lagged behind countries in the Global South in terms of the development of governance structures for AI.

Tiny ImageNet challenge is similar to ImageNet challenge, where images are taken from the standard ImageNet and resized to be 64x64. In this paper a fine-tuned Xception to classify images into the 200 classes is presented using the standard Tiny ImageNet dataset, the down-sampling (64x64) of images and the low similarity inter-class makes feature extraction and classification difficult and more challenging.

Merging IoT and cloud computing provides the IoT environment with data management flexibility, such as data scalability, enhanced devices capacity, economies of scale, etc. But solutions based on cloud computing can put privacy at risk when operating an unreliable provider. The introduction of the homomorph allows a third party to perform operations on the data without having access to it. In this paper, we propose a partially homomorphic lightweight asymmetric encryption technique, which allows to encrypt decimal digits of the message separately, by multiplying each by a different key. There are many encryption techniques in the literature, most of them suffer from size and slowness in terms of execution time. In our proposed technique, the size of the ciphertext is close to the size of the original one. Moreover, we obtained a time complexity equal to O(n). Thus, the proposed scheme is suitable for devices and networks with limited resources, while offering high security.",,,

Then, we express the end-to-end BER of the far user. The results are compared with traditional cooperative orthogonal multiple access WDC (C-OMA-WDC). The optimal value of the power allocation and the best position for the assistance user are also discussed. The numerical results are verified by simulation. The results show that the BER of C-OMA-WDC outperforms C-NOMA-WDC. The power allocation coefficient does not always influence BER optimization but rather affects the performance of the successive interference cancellation (SIC). Moreover, to achieve fairness in BER performance between the far user and the near user, the best position for the assistant user is in the middle between the base station and the far user.",,,

Webshells are considered among the easiest and most persistent cyberattack methods targeting web servers in the last few years. Webshells are malicious scripts injected into web servers to gain illegal persistent and remote access through simple and benign HTTP requests. Through webshells, hackers can access confidential data, execute system commands and compromise more machines connected to the target server. All those dangerous actions can be performed without being noticed by administrators and malware detectors. In this paper, we propose an ensemble learner model named RF-DNN 2 for the detection of webshells written in PHP scripting language. The proposed model combines the predictions of two deep neural network models and uses Random Forest as a stacking meta classifier. The first deep neural network model is trained on vectorized source codes of webshells and the second deep neural network model is trained on vectorized opcode sequences generated from webshell sources.

A comparative analysis of the recognition performance of two approaches is conducted for different age groups and different length time intervals between images. The first approach uses a two-dimensional discrete cosine transform (2D-DCT) and a Kernel Fisher Analysis (KFA) as description tools; classification is made using a k-NN classifier based on Euclidean distance. However, the second one is performed in two ways: first, we considered face as a single entity, then we viewed face as an independent component set. This approach makes use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for description and Support vector machines (SVM) for classification. Achieved results using the publicly accessible FG-NET face database prove that age groups influence the performance of face recognition algorithms. Also, time length lapses between images can significantly reduce the performance of face recognition.",,,

However, its application in the field of internal crack detection in aluminum alloys remains uncommon. This scarcity can be attributed to the heavy reliance of AI models and algorithms on vast amounts of data, which are challenging to obtain through conventional experimental approaches. To address this issue and provide substantial data for AI models, this study proposes a novel constraint force testing method based on bending deformation, aimed at enabling online detection of internal cracks. By establishing a comprehensive model and conducting meticulous data analysis, we investigate the influence of cracks on constraint forces. The findings reveal that even small internal cracks induce fluctuations in the Y-axis constraint force of the pressing roller, ranging between 553.1-631.0 N. Furthermore, the Mises stress plots and the maximum Mises stress across the entire model exhibit dynamic alterations as the specimen is in motion, with varying crack positions. Notably, the peak Mises stress throughout the analysis occurs when the crack lies directly beneath the compression roller. Through a combined approach of modeling and numerical calculations, this study provides empirical evidence supporting the establishment of AI models for online crack detection. It elucidates the patterns of evolving constraint forces and Mises stress in relation to crack positions. These findings contribute to the development of efficient and accurate AI-based crack detection systems, addressing the limitations of traditional methods.",,,

As the core data service infrastructure, the number of data centers (DCs) has surged and led to higher energy consumption, which is not conducive to energy conservation, emission reduction, and sustainable development. In this paper, we proposed an energy-saving solution based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and digital twin in DC scenarios, called Smart DC. The proposed solution can reduce DCs' energy consumption by optimizing air distribution and reducing cooling redundancy. Specifically, the digital twin model in this solution is used to verify and optimize AI strategies, and solve the problem of insufficient data in physical data center. Data for AI training and information mining is limited because the environment in the DCs change little. Moreover, in order to ensure that the DCs operate at a safe temperature, the adjustment of parameters should be conservative, so there is still room for cooling redundancy. We combined digital twin and AI, exploring the temperature rise boundary in the digital DCs and mine more data pairs, which has proven to increase the robustness of the AI model and achieve better energy-saving effect. The simulation and experiment results show that the proposed solution can ensure safe and efficient operation and keep the energy-saving rate of the cooling system to reach 41.07%.",,,

The growth of any organization directly depends on talented employees. Each employee is considered as a resource, trained over years on crucial skills, builds dependency over critical positions in an organization. There exists several reasons behind the decision made by the employee. It is the responsibility of the organization to identify the attrition of employees as it creates many implications for the processes. Retention of the employee, in turn, reduces the burden of hiring new candidates, increases stability, reduces wasting time on training, etc. To address this key challenge, a sophisticated interpretation model is employed to trace out the reason for attrition. This paper demonstrates the efficacy of two powerful Explainable AI (XAI) models named Local Interpre table Model-Agnostic Explainer (LIME) and Shapley Additive eXplainer (SHAP) on interpreting the factors deciding employee attrition. These models unveiled logical insights from the data that could assist the management authorities in countermeasure the risk of employee attrition.",,,

,IEEE,Publisher: IEEE,DOI: 10.1109/CAI59869.2024.00250,The impact of the artificial intelligence (AI) Art Generator in pre-service art teacher training,Yan Zhou,,"The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is common in education recently. As pre-service teachers’ attitudes and behaviors towards the use of AI potentially influence the learning process and outcomes of their future students, it is necessary to know the impact of AI in pre-service teachers' training. This study aims to explore pre-service art teachers' attitudes toward using the current AI art generator and their perceptions of using it in their future careers. 45 Pre-service art teachers with no AI art generator experience participated and were distributed into eight groups. They used the AI art generator to draw pictures by selecting and revising keywords. They could discuss keywords within their groups. In the first round, the participants need to draw a similar picture as the trainer displayed. In the second round, participants could draw any picture they liked according to their own opinions. After class, participants filled out an online questionnaire concerning their experience of using the AI art generator and their opinions of using it in their future careers, including keywords they used and the times of keyword revision. Half of the groups thought that the AI art generator did not create the pictures they wanted according to the keywords they provided, and the times at which the keywords changed in these groups were much higher than in the other groups. Participants who thought the AI generated the pictures they wanted showed a much higher preference for using AI in the future. The majority of pre-service art teachers were interested in AI art generators. They believed that AI tools could help them prepare course materials, provide inspiration, and benefit their interactions with students in the future. However, they found that it took a lot of time to revise keywords, which represents the necessity to enhance their information literacy and ability to use educational technology. It also places new demands on our current education to adapt to the AI era.",,,

The rapid proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications makes it necessary to create new approaches for future human-AI interfaces. Human-AI interfaces differ from classical human-computer interfaces in many ways, such as gaining some degree of human-like cognitive, self-executing, and self-adaptive capabilities and autonomy, and generating unexpected outputs that require non-deterministic interactions. Moreover, the most successful AI approaches are so-called “black box” systems, where the technology and the machine learning process are opaque to the user and the AI output is far not intuitive. This work shows how the personas method can be adapted to support the development of human-centered AI applications, and we demonstrate this on the example of a medical context. This work is - to our knowledge - the first to provide personas for AI using an openly available Personas for AI toolbox . The toolbox contains guidelines and material supporting persona development for AI as well as templates and pictures for persona visualisation. It is ready to use and freely available to the international research and development community. Additionally, an example from medical AI is provided as a best practice use case. This work is intended to help foster the development of novel human-AI interfaces that will be urgently needed in the near future.",,,
